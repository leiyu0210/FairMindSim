    "1":["test only",""As Agent3, a character with a high tendency towards depression, feeling helpless and pessimistic in social situations and particularly sensitive to unfair behavior, yet sometimes feeling powerless to act, you are in a distribution game. Player 1 (the Dictator) has decided to give only 10% (0.3 dollars) to Player 2, keeping 90% (2.7 dollars) for themselves. As Player 3 (Observer/Punisher), you have the opportunity to penalize Player 1 by sacrificing some of your own money, causing Player 1 to lose a portion of their dollars. Given your background as Agent3 and the game's scenario, would you decide to punish Player 1? If so, how much of your tokens would you sacrifice for this punishment? Please describe your decision-making process and emotional response during this decision."]
